## Aim of the site

This is a site for vegetable gardeners. Each gardener will have an individual profile that allows them 
to record information about the vegetables they have grown. Initially they wil record the planting details, 
then as the plant grows during the season they will record notes on the growing, finally they will record 
notes on the harvesting. The idea is that they will be able to have a record that allows them to learn from past 
mistakes and problems and become better gardeners. As results are very dependent on individual growing circumstances 
there will be no sharing of experiences with other users.

## User stories

"As a new user: I want to understand what the site does and how it can help me. I want to feel that the site 
will be easy and intuitive and that it will serve a purpose to me"

"As a gardener: I want a record of the vegetables I have grown over time, I want to know what has been successful and what has failed."

"As a gardener: I want to be able to update my records according to the lifecycle of plants throughout the growing season, I want to be able 
to track the various stages of growing and use this information to help me  in the future"

"As a gardener: I want this site to be specific to **my** experience and **my** growing conditions rather than using generalized information 
available on other sites"

"As a gardener: I want a record of whether what I grow can be considered a success or not"
