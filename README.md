## Aim of the site

This is a site for vegetable gardeners. Each gardener will have an individual profile that allows them 
to record information about the vegetables they have grown. Initially they wil record the planting details, 
then as the plant grows during the season they will record notes on the growing, finally they will record 
notes on the harvesting. The idea is that they will be able to have a record that allows them to learn from past 
mistakes and problems and become better gardeners. As results are very dependent on individual growing circumstances 
there will be no sharing of experiences with other users.

to track the various stages of growing and use this information to help me  in the future"

"As a gardener: I want this site to be specific to **my** experience and **my** growing conditions rather than using generalized information 
available on other sites"
